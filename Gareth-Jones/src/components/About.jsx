            Hi, I&apos;m Gareth. A Full Stack Developer based in New Zealand.
            I&apos;m passionate about being creative and love bringing awesome
            ideas to life through code.
            <br />
            My journey into the tech world started quite recently. After
            completing several free programming courses, I discovered my love
            for coding while learning HTML5 and CSS. Needless to say, I was
            hooked!
            <br />
            To take my skills further, I enrolled in an intensive 17-week
            bootcamp at Dev Academy. There, I learned a variety of languages and
            frameworks, met some incredible people, and truly discovered the
            meaning of teamwork.
            <br />
            I&apos;m excited to continue growing and learning as I build a
            fulfilling career in tech! <br />
            When I&apos;m not coding, you can usually find me indulging in some
            nerdy hobbies like watching anime, playing video games, or enjoying
            a good game of Magic: The Gathering. Recently, I&apos;ve also picked
            up gardening as a new hobby. I also love walking and exploring the
            outdoors.
